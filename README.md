# 🛰 Andromeda Life Insurance Pilot

## 🧭 Mission

**Build a repeatable Meta ads system (Andromeda-era)** for life insurance that:
- Runs on clean, isolated data (Pixel + CAPI)
- Follows Meta’s modern retrieval and learning structure
- Uses creative diversity to train the algorithm effectively
- Captures and returns real sales data for continuous optimization

This pilot proves that a clean, closed-loop advertising ecosystem can stabilize performance, improve lead quality, and reduce daily ad management time.
