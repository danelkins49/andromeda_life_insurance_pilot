# Creative — Quiz + Ad Angles

## Single Big Idea
“Find the **best life insurance** for *your* situation — without guesswork.”

## Quiz Skeleton (MVP)
1) Household + Dependents  
2) Income band / budget comfort  
3) Priority (price stability, living benefits, cash value)  
4) Health snapshot (no PHI; high-level)  
5) Contact (name, email, phone) → result page

**Outcome:** Personalized result page + email tag(s) for follow-up.

## Initial Ad Angle Buckets (launch with 4–5)
- **Identification:** “First Responders / Veterans / Nurses” — *who it’s for*
- **New Mechanism:** “How modern life insurance pays **while you’re alive**”
- **Proof/Case:** Mini-testimonial or day-in-the-life
- **Objection Flip:** “No medical exam / fast approval / level premiums”
- **Direct Response (MOFU/BOFU):** “Get your personalized plan in 60 seconds”

## Creative To-Do
- [ ] Write 3 hooks per angle (pull from your Hooks/Recipes playbooks)
- [ ] One square video, one 4:5 video, one static per angle
- [ ] Result page copy that mirrors the ad promise
